# Microservices with .NET and Next.js

This project is a practical implementation of a microservices architecture using .NET and Next.js, developed as part of an Udemy course focused on learning these technologies. The aim is to build a robust and scalable application by breaking down the functionality into distinct, loosely-coupled services.

## Features
- Microservices Architecture: Each service is independent, allowing for easy scaling and maintenance.
- Next.js Frontend: A modern, server-side rendered React application.
- API Gateway: A single entry point for the client applications to communicate with the backend services.
- Docker : Containerized services using Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.


## Technologies
- Backend: .NET, Entity Framework Core
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- Database: MongoDB, postreSQL
- Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
